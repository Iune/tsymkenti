<p>In the table above, we can see the consonant inventory for Minhari. In addition to the phonemes shown above, the nasals, fricatives, and non-ejective plosives have geminate counterparts, which is indicated below by a doubling of the consonant in question. There are several additional sounds that appear as a result of allophony or consonant gradation, both of which will be discussed below.</p>

<p>The alveolar nasal /<span class="ipa">n</span>/ has two allophones: the velar nasal /<span class="ipa">ŋ</span>/ and the uvular nasal /<span class="ipa">ɴ</span>/. The former appears when /<span class="ipa">n</span>/ is followed by a velar consonant, the latter when /<span class="ipa">n</span>/ is followed by a uvular consonant.</p>

<h4>Consonant Gradation</h4>

<p>Similar to many Finnic languages, such as Finnish, Estonian and Sámi, Minhari also displays consonant gradation with regards to its plosive consonants. While Minhari’s consonant gradation paradigms are quite similar to that of Finnish, there are some notable differences, largely stemming from Finnish’s general lack of voiced plosives, which are found in Minhari.</p>
				
<p>Consonants are found in one of two grades: a “strong” grade and a “weak grade”; the grade a consonant is in largely depends on the structure of the syllable containing the consonant. Consonants are in the weak grade if they are the first consonant in a non-initial closed syllable, and are in the strong grade otherwise.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Geminate plosives shorten in the weak grade.</li>
	<li>Non-ejective short plosives are voiced in the weak grade. The uvular plosive /q/ is an exception to this pattern and becomes an approximant /ʁ/ instead of voicing to /ɢ/ as might be expected.</li>
	<li>Ejective plosives become non-ejective plosives in the weak grade.</li>
	<li>Short plosives that follow a nasal consonant assimilate to that nasal consonant when found in the weak grade.</li> 
	<li>Short plosives that follow a fricative fricate when found in the weak grade.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Vowels</h3>

<p>In the table above, we can see the eight monophthong vowels in Minhari. When found in unstressed syllables, the open vowels /<span class="ipa">ɑ æ</span>/ both reduce to the schwa /<span class="ipa">ə</span>/ while /<span class="ipa">e i o u y ø/ reduce to /ɛ ɪ ʌ ʊ ʏ ɵ/ respectively. The unstressed vowels are are pronounced for roughly three-quarters the time they are pronounced in stressed positions.</p>

<p>Diphthongs, shown in the table above, are pronounced for twice the length of a monophthong vowel when found in stressed positions, and one-and-half times in unstressed positions.</p>

<h3>Phonotactics</h3>
<p>Affricates, ejectives and geminate consonants cannot cluster. This means that these three category of consonants must appear either at the end of a word, or followed by a vowel. When combining words together during compounding, if a word ending in one of these consonants is followed by a word beginning with a consonant such that a consonant cluster would form, an epenthetic /<span class="ipa">ɑ</span>/ is inserted following the first word to prevent this illegal cluster.</p>

<h3>Prosody</h3>
<p>Minhari’s stress pattern is regular, and falls on the penultimate (second-to-last) syllable in multisyllabic words. Monosyllabic words do not receive stress.</p>

<h2>Orthography</h2>
<p>Minhari is written using the Latin alphabet, supplemented with additional digraphs and diacritics to accurately represent all of the sounds found in the language. This alphabet can be seen in the table below.</p>

<p>While the alphabet is generally one-to-one correspondence between the written character and the sound pronounced, there are some exceptions that result from consonant gradation. Generally speaking, the effects of consonant gradation are written down as pronounced, such as when /p/ &lt;p&gt; is voiced in the weak grade to become /d/ &lt;d&gt;.</p>

<p>However, when a short plosive follows a nasal, it assimilates to match that nasal in the weak grade. As the alveolar nasal /<span class="ipa">n</span>/ has allophones /<span class="ipa">ŋ</span>/ and /<span class="ipa">ɴ</span>/ when it precedes a velar or uvular consonant respectively, the use of &lt;<span class="ipa">nn</span>&gt; to represent the weak grade assimilation of the plosive to match the nasal would result in an ambigious pronounciation. To resolve this ambiguity, the assimilated consonant written as if it was voiced. For example, /<span class="ipa">ŋ.k</span>/, which becomes [<span class="ipa">ŋ.ŋ</span>], is written as &lt;ng&gt;.</p>

<h2>Nouns</h2>

<p>Minhari nouns are marked for number and case by the use of suffixes appended to the word stem; the number marker appears closer to the stem than the case marker. There is no grammatical gender in Minhari.</p>

<h3>Number</h3>
<p>Minhari marks nouns for two numbers: the singular and plural, with the singular being unmarked. The plural is marked with the suffix <em>-n</em>, which is appended immediately after the noun stem.</p>
